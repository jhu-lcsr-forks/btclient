There are now two versions of puck firmware in the field. Consequently there
is a compile-time switch to control how the WAM client software is built. (the
changes are centered around how and where the pucks get their configuration 
information. In the new firmware, a new, better, configuration file is used.)


Requires:

Linux 2.4.x or 2.6.x
RTAI 3.1,3.2
esdcan driver (libntcan)


Quickstart:

Important! If you have the old puck firmware: (presently UAlberta,MIT,CMU,RIC,B.PW,UTenn)
You need to add -DBTOLDCONFIG to the Makefiles in the btsystem & btwam libraries.

#cd src/btdiag
#chmod 755 makeall run
#./makeall

Power up wam
Idle wam
#./run
