This is the 'examples' directory.

Start by reviewing Example 1 (ex1). It documents the basic structure of a WAM
program. Later examples build on ex1's structure, but their comments serve to
highlight the particular features being presented instead of repeating the 
description of the program structure.

NOTE: Examples 5 and 6 are planned, but not written yet. Do not worry
about them.

Happy coding!
