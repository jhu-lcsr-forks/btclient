Example 3 - Teach & Play with the WAM

This is a program that demonstrates basic teach & play functionality. It uses
ncurses to provide a simple interactive user interface. The main() and ProcessInput() 
functions do all the interesting work.

To compile & run

1. #make
2. Switch on WAM
3. Idle WAM (press SHIFT and IDLE buttons on pendant. The yellow light should come on)
4. #./run

Things to note:

./.runinfo - The name of your executable is placed in this config file. ./run is
a script to do all the things needed by RTAI in order to run your program in realtime.

./Makefile - note the location of the barrett include files and libraries

The esdcan-driver module must be loaded. Use #lsmod to see if it is.
